This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I've tried using the service-worker, registering on page load. The code also verifies first if support for service worker is present or not before registering the worker.
I used lighthouse to verify the PWA score, but frankly couldn't check all the boxes.

Thank you.
